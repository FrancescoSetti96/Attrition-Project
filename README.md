I've recently noticed that there is an issue rendering the Jupyter notebook file that I've uploaded for this project. This is very odd because the notebook was being rendered correctly when I originally uploaded it a few months ago. I've tried a few potential fixes but the problem persists. For convenience, I've uploaded the notebook content in a downloadable PDF file.
